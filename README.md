# About
Instagram allows you to add between 1 and 4 pronouns from different languages next to your name. I wanted to find out what English words you can create by combining those pronouns.

# Remarks
The dictionary with the english words was taken from the repo [english-words](https://github.com/dwyl/english-words).

I turned the character "채" of the pronouns "h채n", "h채net" and "h채nen" into a simple "a" in order to find more words.

The script takes a bit of time to find all the possible words.
